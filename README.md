# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction & ECG Analysis

This project is part of my internship (Day 5 task) and focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning models like Decision Trees and Random Forests. It also includes exploratory analysis of ECG data to enhance clinical insights.

## 📁 Datasets Used

1. **heart.csv**  
   - Contains patient-level clinical data including age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more.
   - Target column indicates presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

2. **ecg.csv**  
   - Contains ECG signal data for multiple patients.
   - Used for visualizing heart activity and identifying patterns.

3. **ecg_data**  
   - Supplementary ECG dataset 
   - Used for advanced signal analysis and visualization.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Predict heart disease using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
- Visualize feature importance and model performance.
- Analyze ECG data to understand cardiac patterns.
- Compare models and tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Key Features

- Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots
- Decision Tree visualization
- Random Forest feature importance
- ECG signal scatter plots and analysis
- Model comparison and cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

## 📈 Results

| Model           | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| Decision Tree  | ~84%     |
| Random Forest  | ~88%     |

> Accuracy may vary depending on preprocessing and parameter tuning.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload `heart.csv`, `ecg.csv`, and `ecg_data` to your Colab environment.
2. Run the notebook `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`.
3. All visualizations and results will be generated automatically.
